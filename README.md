# Week 3: Flutter Basics

## Overview

This week we will be learning the basics of Flutter. Flutter is a cross-platform mobile app development framework that allows you to write code once and deploy it to both iOS and Android. Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which is similar to Java and JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Create a Flutter project
- Run a Flutter project on an emulator or physical device
- Use the Flutter documentation to learn about widgets
- Create a simple Flutter app with one page using stateless widgets
- file management

### 2. Flutter Basic Widgets

- Go into the `lib` folder and open `main.dart`

#### Looking at the code

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MainApp());
}

class MainApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MainApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello World!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

- The `main()` function is the entry point of the app. It is where the app starts executing.
- The `runApp()` function takes a widget and runs it. In this case, we are running the `MainApp` widget.
- The `MainApp` widget is a stateless widget. Stateless widgets are immutable, meaning that their properties can't changeâ€”all values are final. This widget does not have to be called `MainApp`, but it is good practice to name your widget the same as your file.
- The `MainApp` widget has a `build()` method that returns a widget. This is the widget that will be displayed when the app is launched.
- The `MainApp` widget returns a `MaterialApp` widget. The `MaterialApp` widget is a widget that provides a framework for implementing the basic material design layout of your app.

#### [MaterialApp](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html)

```dart
MaterialApp(
    title: 'Weather App',
    theme: ThemeData(
      primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
    ),
    home: const Scaffold(),
    debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
);
```

- The `MaterialApp` widget is the root widget of your app. It is what allows you to use Material Design components in your app.
- The `MaterialApp` widget has a `home` property that takes a widget. This is the widget that will be displayed when the app is launched.
- The `MaterialApp` widget also has a `theme` property that takes a `ThemeData` object. This is where you can customize the theme of your app.
- The `MaterialApp` widget also has a `title` property that takes a string. This is the title of your app that will be displayed in the app switcher.
- The `MaterialApp` widget also has a `debugShowCheckedModeBanner` property that takes a boolean. This is whether or not you want the debug banner to be displayed in the top right corner of your app.

### 3. Importing Assets

#### Modifying the `pubspec.yaml` file

- Go into the `pubspec.yaml` file
- Under the `flutter` section, you'll see a `assets` section
- Add the following code to the `assets` section:

```yaml
  - assets/images/
```

- This will tell Flutter to look in the `assets/images/` folder for any assets that you want to use in your app
- Save the `pubspec.yaml` file

#### Adding an image

- create a folder called `images` in the `assets` folder
- add an image to the `images` folder

#### AssetImage vs NetworkImage

- There are two ways to add an image to your app
  - `AssetImage`
    - This is used for images that are stored locally in your app
  - `NetworkImage`
    - This is used for images that are stored on the internet

#### AssetImage

```dart
Image(
  image: AssetImage('assets/images/image.png'),
);
```

- The `Image` widget is a widget that displays an image.
- The `Image` widget has an `image` property that takes an `ImageProvider` object. This is the image that will be displayed.
- The `AssetImage` widget is a widget that displays an image that is stored locally in your app.

#### NetworkImage

```dart
Image(
  image: NetworkImage('https://picsum.photos/200'),
);
```

- The `NetworkImage` widget is a widget that displays an image that is stored on the internet.
- The `NetworkImage` widget has a `url` property that takes a string. This is the url of the image that will be displayed.
- The `Image` widget is a widget that displays an image.

#### Adding an image to a container

```dart
Container(
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    image: DecorationImage(
      image: AssetImage('assets/images/image.png'),
    ),
  ),
);
```

- The `Container` widget is a widget that allows you to customize the size, color, and child of a widget.
- The `Container` widget has a `decoration` property that takes a `BoxDecoration` object. This is the decoration of the container.
- The `BoxDecoration` widget is a widget that allows you to customize the decoration of a container.
- The `BoxDecoration` widget has an `image` property that takes a `DecorationImage` object. This is the image that will be displayed in the container.

#### 4. Creating a custom widget (example: detailsRow)

- Go into the `lib` folder and create a folder called `widgets`
- Create a file called `details_row.dart` in the `widgets` folder

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class DetailsRow extends StatelessWidget {
  const DetailsRow({
    super.key,
    required this.text,
    required this.icon,
  });

  final String text;
  final Icon icon;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Row(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
      children: [
        icon,
        Text(
          text,
          style: const TextStyle(
            color: Colors.black,
            fontSize: 20,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
          ),
        ),
        const SizedBox(),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

- The `DetailsRow` widget is a widget that displays a row of details.
- We have created a custom widget called `DetailsRow` that takes two properties: `text` and `icon`.
- The `text` property is a string that will be displayed in the row.
- The `icon` property is an icon that will be displayed in the row.

#### Using the custom widget

- Go into the `main.dart` file
- Import the `DetailsRow` widget

```dart
import 'widgets/details_row.dart';
```

- Use the `DetailsRow` widget

```dart
DetailsRow(
  text: 'Feels Like 70Â°',
  icon: const Icon(
    Icons.thermostat_outlined,
    color: Colors.black,
  ),
),
```

### 5. Creating a screen

- Go into the `lib` folder and create a folder called `screens`
- Create a file called `home_screen.dart` in the `screens` folder

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomeScreen({
    super.key,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Weather App'),
      ),
      body: const Center(
        child: Text('Hello World!'),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {},
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

- The `HomeScreen` page is a widget that displays the home screen of the app.
- We have created a custom page called `HomeScreen`.
- The `HomeScreen` page is a stateless widget. Stateless widgets are immutable, meaning that their properties can't changeâ€”all values are final. This widget does not have to be called `HomeScreen`, but it is good practice to name your widget the same as your file.

#### Using the screen

- Go into the `main.dart` file
- Import the `HomeScreen` page

```dart
import 'screens/home_screen.dart';
```

- Use the `HomeScreen` page

```dart
MaterialApp(
  title: 'Weather App',
  theme: ThemeData(
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
  ),
  home: const HomeScreen(),
  debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
);
```

## Task: Creating a Single Page Weather App

Your job is to create a single page weather app that displays the current weather conditions for a given location. This will only be front-end development, so you will not need to worry about fetching data from an API.

The design of the app is up to you, and you can use any resources you want to help you with the design. You can use the [Flutter Gallery](https://gallery.flutter.dev/#/) as a reference.

However, The structure of the app should follow the requirements below.

### Requirements

- The app should have a screens folder containing any screen created in a separate file
- The app should have a widgets folder containing any custom widgets created in a separate file

### Optional Requirements

- The app should have a models folder containing any models created in a separate file (Example, WeatherStatusModel)
- Create a simple layout for the app that includes a text field for entering a location and a button to submit the location.
- Display the current weather conditions for the location in a card or container.

### Provided examples

- [Login Page](/lib/example/LoginPage/)
- [MiCard](/lib/example/MiCard/)
